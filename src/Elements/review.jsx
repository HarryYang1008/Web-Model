Also, at first, I thought ball deodorant and toner was a bit excessive but now that I used it I would highly recommend. The boxer briefs are soft and just as good or better than other primo brands.",

Not just physically but in return you get peace of mind knowing everything is natural, safe, and best of all easy to use. I'm a manscaped customer for life. You should give it a try and enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.",
